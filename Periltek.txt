Periltek Designs is a small indie development startup built on creativity and curiosity. Originally focused on game design and interactive media, its been decided to apply the same spirit of fun and innovation to something more practicalâ€”The Red: RRG Mobile.

We're building a team to lay the foundations for the next major goal; evolving into a AAA game production studio based in the RRG.
