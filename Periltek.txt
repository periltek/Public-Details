Periltek Designs is a small indie development startup built on creativity and curiosity. Originally focused on game design and interactive media, the team decided to apply the same spirit of fun and innovation to something more practical—The Red Mobile.

Now entering a new chapter, Periltek is undergoing a complete facelift—refocusing its vision toward long-term growth and local impact. The team’s next major goal is to evolve into a AAA game production studio based in the Red River Gorge region, with development centers planned for Campton and Stanton, Kentucky. Through this expansion, Periltek hopes to bring a new form of creative industry and sustainable income to the area, blending technology, artistry, and community growth into one mission-driven effort.
