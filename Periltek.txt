Periltek Designs is a small indie development startup rooted in creativity and curiosity. Originally focused on game design and interactive media, we've decided to channel that same spirit of fun and innovation into something more practical—The Red: RRG Mobile.

We're assembling a team to lay the groundwork for our next major goal: a camping simulator and our flagship title, 'Camp Red.' This will be a sandbox survival simulator and a recreational sandbox game. Stay tuned for more details as we build toward this exciting vision.
