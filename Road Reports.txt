The Road Report provides a live, refreshable image feed of the Mountain Parkway, offering travelers a real-time view of current road and weather conditions. Designed to keep visitors informed before they even begin their trip, the report automatically updates to deliver the most recent snapshot available.

Once fully launched, the Road Report will expand to include detailed traffic updates, weather alerts, and maintenance noticesâ€”offering a clear, reliable overview of travel conditions throughout the Red River Gorge region.
